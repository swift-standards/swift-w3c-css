/// This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction. It affects
/// the alignment of text, images, and other inline elements.
///
/// - Note: The values `start` and `end` are calculated according to the text direction.
///         In left-to-right text, `start` aligns to the left. In right-to-left text,
///         `start` aligns to the right.
