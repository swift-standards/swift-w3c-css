/// The CSS `text-rendering` property provides information to the rendering engine about what to optimize for when rendering text.
///
/// The browser makes trade-offs among speed, legibility, and geometric precision. This property can significantly
/// affect the display of text, particularly when using ligatures and kerning which are important for many languages
/// and scripts.
///
/// - Note: This property is an SVG property that is not defined in any CSS standard. However, browsers
///         let you apply this property to HTML and XML content on various platforms.
///
/// - Note: One very visible effect is `optimizeLegibility`, which enables ligatures (ff, fi, fl, etc.)
///         in text smaller than 20px for some fonts (for example, Microsoft's Calibri, Candara, Constantia,
///         and Corbel, or the DejaVu font family).
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .textRendering(.auto)                // text-rendering: auto
/// .textRendering(.optimizeSpeed)       // text-rendering: optimizeSpeed
/// .textRendering(.optimizeLegibility)  // text-rendering: optimizeLegibility
/// .textRendering(.geometricPrecision)  // text-rendering: geometricPrecision
/// ```
///
