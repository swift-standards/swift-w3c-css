/// The CSS `text-transform` property specifies how to capitalize an element's text.
///
/// It can be used to make text appear in all-uppercase or all-lowercase, or with each word capitalized.
/// It also can help improve legibility for ruby.
///
/// - Note: The text-transform property takes into account language-specific case mapping rules such as:
///   - In Turkic languages, there are two kinds of i, with and without the dot, and two case pairings: i/İ and ı/I.
///   - In German, the ß becomes SS in uppercase.
///   - In Dutch, the ij digraph becomes IJ, even with text-transform: capitalize
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on text-transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform)
