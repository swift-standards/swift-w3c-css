/// The CSS `white-space` property sets how white space inside an element is handled.
///
/// This property specifies two things:
/// - Whether and how white space is collapsed
/// - Whether and how lines wrap
///
/// - Note: To make words break within themselves, use `overflow-wrap`, `word-break`, or `hyphens` instead.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on white-space](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/white-space)
