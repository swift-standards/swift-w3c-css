/// The CSS `color-interpolation-filters` property specifies the color space for imaging operations
/// performed via SVG filter effects.
///
/// This property differs from `color-interpolation` which controls standard color interpolation. It's
/// important to note that the default value of `color-interpolation` is `sRGB`, while the default for
/// `color-interpolation-filters` is `linearRGB`.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .colorInterpolationFilters(.auto)       // color-interpolation-filters: auto
/// .colorInterpolationFilters(.sRGB)       // color-interpolation-filters: sRGB
/// .colorInterpolationFilters(.linearRGB)  // color-interpolation-filters: linearRGB
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This property only applies to SVG filter operations and has no effect on filter primitives
///         like `<feOffset>`, `<feImage>`, `<feTile>`, and `<feFlood>`. Instead, it applies to the
///         various filter effect elements like `<feBlend>`.
///
