/// Represents a CSS algorithm used for interpolation between hue values.
///
/// The `HueInterpolationMethod` specifies how to find a midpoint between two hue values
/// based on a color wheel. It is used as a component of color interpolation methods,
/// particularly in gradient and animation contexts.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .linearGradient(to: .right, in: .hsl, .shorter,  // Use shorter hue path
///                 colors: [.hex("#f60"), .hex("#ff0")])
/// ```
///
/// - Note: There are four possible algorithms to determine which arc is used
///         when interpolating between two hue angles on a color wheel.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on hue-interpolation-method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hue-interpolation-method)
public enum HueInterpolationMethod: String, Sendable, Hashable {
    /// Use the shorter arc between the two hues on the color wheel.
    ///
    /// When the two hues are exactly opposite (180 degrees apart), this algorithm
    /// defaults to a clockwise direction if the first hue < second hue,
    /// or counterclockwise if the first hue > second hue.
    case shorter = "shorter hue"

    /// Use the longer arc between the two hues on the color wheel.
    ///
    /// This method takes the longer path around the color wheel, which can be
    /// useful for effects that require a broader color transition.
    case longer = "longer hue"

    /// Always use the clockwise arc regardless of which is shorter.
    ///
    /// This ensures consistent clockwise interpolation, which can be useful
    /// for predictable transitions in certain designs.
    case increasing = "increasing hue"

    /// Always use the counterclockwise arc regardless of which is shorter.
    ///
    /// This ensures consistent counterclockwise interpolation, which can be
    /// useful for predictable transitions in certain designs.
