/// The CSS `unicode-bidi` property, together with the `direction` property, determines how bidirectional text
/// in a document is handled.
///
/// For example, if a block of content contains both left-to-right and right-to-left text,
/// the user-agent uses a complex Unicode algorithm to decide how to display the text.
/// The `unicode-bidi` property overrides this algorithm and allows the developer to control the text embedding.
///
/// - Note: The `unicode-bidi` and `direction` properties are the only properties that are not affected
///         by the `all` shorthand.
///
/// - Warning: This property is intended for Document Type Definition (DTD) designers.
///            Web designers and similar authors should not override it.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on unicode-bidi](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/unicode-bidi)
