/// Represents CSS blend mode values for combining colors when elements overlap.
///
/// The `BlendMode` data type defines how colors should appear when elements or backgrounds
/// overlap. It is used in the `background-blend-mode` and `mix-blend-mode` properties.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .backgroundBlendMode(.multiply)  // Creates a multiplicative blending effect
/// .mixBlendMode(.overlay)          // Applies overlay blending to an element
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Blend modes determine how the foreground (top layer) and background (bottom layer)
///         colors interact to produce a final color. Different blend modes can create
///         various visual effects, from simple transparency to complex color transformations.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on blend-mode values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/blend-mode)
