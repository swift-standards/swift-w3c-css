/// The CSS `transform-style` property sets whether children of an element are positioned in the 3D space
/// or are flattened in the plane of the element.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .transformStyle(.flat)        // transform-style: flat
/// .transformStyle(.preserve3D)  // transform-style: preserve-3d
/// ```
///
/// - Note: If flattened (`flat`), the element's children will not exist on their own in the 3D-space.
/// - Note: As this property is not inherited, it must be set for all non-leaf descendants of the element.
/// - Note: Certain properties can force the element to have a `flat` transform style even when `preserve-3d` is specified,
///         including non-default values of: overflow, opacity, filter, clip, clip-path, isolation, mask-image,
///         mask-border-source, mix-blend-mode, and contain.
///
