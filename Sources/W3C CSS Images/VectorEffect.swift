///
/// This allows effects like a road on a map staying the same width no matter how the map is zoomed,
/// or a diagram key retaining its position and size regardless of other transforms.
///
/// - Note: This property can only be used with SVG elements that accept the vector-effect attribute.
///         When used, the CSS value overrides any values of the element's vector-effect attribute.
