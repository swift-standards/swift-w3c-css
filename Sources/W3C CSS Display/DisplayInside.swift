/// Represents CSS display inside values that determine the layout of an element's contents.
///
/// The `DisplayInside` data type specifies the element's inner display type, which defines
/// the formatting context used to lay out its contents. These values can be used alone
/// or combined with an outer display type in the `display` property.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .display(.flex)           // Flex container (block-level)
/// .display(.grid)           // Grid container (block-level)
/// .display(.flowRoot)       // Block formatting context
/// ```
///
/// - Note: When used alone, browsers that support the two-value syntax will
///         implicitly set the outer display type to `block` for values like
///         `flex` and `grid`.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on display-inside values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display-inside)

    /// ```css
    /// display: flow;
    /// ```

    /// display: flow-root;
    /// ```
    case flowRoot = "flow-root"

    /// Table layout
    ///

    /// with a specific layout model for rows, columns, and cells.

    /// ```
