/// Represents CSS content distribution values for aligning items within a container.
///
/// The `ContentDistribution` data type is used by properties like `justify-content`,
/// `align-content`, and the `place-content` shorthand to distribute space among items
/// in flex containers, grid containers, and other layout models.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .justifyContent(.spaceBetween)  // Distribute items with equal space between
/// .alignContent(.spaceAround)     // Distribute items with equal space around
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Content distribution values determine how extra space is distributed
///         when the total size of all items is less than the container size.
///
/// - SeeAlso: [MDN Web Docs on content-distribution values](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content-distribution)
