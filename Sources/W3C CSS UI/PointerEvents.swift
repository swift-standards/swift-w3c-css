/// The `pointer-events` CSS property sets under what circumstances (if any)
/// a particular graphic element can become the target of pointer events.
///
/// This property is commonly used to control whether an element can be clicked, dragged,
/// or receive other mouse/touch interactions.
///
/// Example:
/// ```css
/// pointer-events: none; /* Element won't receive pointer events */
/// pointer-events: auto; /* Default behavior */
/// ```

    case none
