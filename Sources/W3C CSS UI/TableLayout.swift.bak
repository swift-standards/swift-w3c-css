/// The `table-layout` CSS property sets the algorithm used to lay out table cells, rows, and columns.
///
/// - `auto`: The automatic table layout algorithm adjusts the widths of the table and its cells
///   to fit the content. This is the default algorithm used by most browsers.
///
/// - `fixed`: A faster algorithm where column widths are determined by the first row or by column
///   elements with explicit widths. This allows the table to be rendered earlier but might cause
///   content overflow if cells contain more content than the calculated width allows.
///
/// ```css
/// table-layout: auto;
/// table-layout: fixed;
