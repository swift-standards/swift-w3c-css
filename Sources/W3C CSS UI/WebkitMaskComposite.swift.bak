/// The non-standard `-webkit-mask-composite` property specifies the manner in which
/// multiple mask images applied to the same element are composited with one another.
///
/// Mask images are composited in the opposite order that they are declared with the
/// -webkit-mask-image property.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// // Use source-over compositing (default)
/// .webkitMaskComposite(.sourceOver)
///
/// // Clear overlapping pixels
/// .webkitMaskComposite(.clear)
///
/// // Use XOR compositing
/// .webkitMaskComposite(.xor)
///
/// // Multiple composite operations for multiple masks
/// .webkitMaskComposite([.xor, .sourceOver, .sourceIn])
/// ```
///
/// - Note: This is a non-standard property and may not be supported by all browsers.
///         Consider using the standard `mask-composite` property for production sites,
///         though it uses different keywords.
