/// The `overflow-anchor` CSS property provides a way to opt out of the browser's scroll anchoring behavior,
/// which adjusts scroll position to minimize content shifts.
///
/// Scroll anchoring behavior is enabled by default in any browser that supports it. This property
/// allows you to control whether an element should be considered as a potential anchor point
/// when the browser adjusts scroll position in response to content changes.
///
/// Example:
/// ```swift
/// .overflowAnchor(.auto)    // overflow-anchor: auto
/// .overflowAnchor(.none)    // overflow-anchor: none
/// ```
///
/// - Note: Changing this property to `none` is typically only required if you are experiencing problems
///         with scroll anchoring in a document or part of a document and need to turn the behavior off.
///
