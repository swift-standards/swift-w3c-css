/// Represents the CSS `:scope` pseudo-class.
///
/// The `:scope` pseudo-class matches elements that are a reference point for selectors to match against.
/// In the context of a stylesheet, it matches the root element. When used with scoped stylesheets or JavaScript APIs like querySelector, it matches the scoping element.
///
/// Example:
/// ```css
/// :scope > p {
///     color: blue;
/// }
/// ```
///
