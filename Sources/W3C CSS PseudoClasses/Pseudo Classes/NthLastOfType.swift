/// Represents the CSS `:nth-last-of-type()` pseudo-class.

/// The `:nth-last-of-type()` pseudo-class matches elements based on their position among siblings of the same type, counting from the end.
/// It can accept numeric values, keywords (odd/even), or An+B notation formulas.
///
/// Example:
/// ```css
/// p:nth-last-of-type(odd) {
///     background-color: #f2f2f2;
/// }
/// p:nth-last-of-type(2) {
///     color: red;
/// }
/// ```
