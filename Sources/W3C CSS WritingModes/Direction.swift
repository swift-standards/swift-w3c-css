/// The CSS `direction` property sets the direction of text, table columns, and horizontal overflow.

/// Use `rtl` for languages written from right to left (like Hebrew or Arabic), and `ltr` for those
/// written from left to right (like English and most other languages).

/// - Warning: Where possible, authors are encouraged to avoid using the direction CSS property
///            and use the HTML dir global attribute instead.

/// - Note: The `direction` and `unicode-bidi` properties are the only two properties which are
///         not affected by the `all` shorthand property.
